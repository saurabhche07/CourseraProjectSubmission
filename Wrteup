•	The training data was downloaded
•	CLasse variable was predicted using different techniques like glm, rpart and randomForest
•	randomForest had the highest accuracy so it was used as the method for the model technique
•	Using Varimp function variable importance was found and the least important variables were dropped. Based on which top 20 variables were selected.
The model had the below summary -
1.	Type of random forest: classification
2.	Number of trees: 100
3.	No. of variables tried at each split: 4
4.	OOB estimate of  error rate: 0.09%
Confusion matrix:
     A    B    C    D    E  class.error
A 4460    0    0    0    0 0.0000000000
B    2 3027    0    0    0 0.0006602839
C    0    4 2766    0    0 0.0014440433
D    0    0    3 2600    1 0.0015360983
E    0    0    0    4 2891 0.0013816926

Out of sample error was tested using K fold classification
With k = 5,
Out of sample error was very minimal. Hence the model was fine.
Model was used on testing data and all 20 values were predicted correctly
